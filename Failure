This was most definitely not our main plan. We initially thought that we had it under our control but it ended up snowballing into a large mess. Commotion arose around me while I stood there, desperately praying for an idea to come to my head. Some people were having shouting matches and even started throwing our brown beer bottles at each other that we had used to store the precious clear water that we collected from the wells in our village. At every bottle broken, my emotions were like the shattered glass pieces that reflected
into a thousand different colours under the sun, rolling about in me. Those bottles were the last memory we had of our village before it was burned to the ground by our rivals.
Many lived were lost. It stung even thinking about it. How were we going to proceed with this, when we did not even have a plan?  Failure! The word blazed fiercely accross my mind. She had warned us about this but we all deemed it as a joke, chuckling while we sat at the crackling fire saying, "Don't be silly. that won't happen." We had thought that we would see the last of them. but as fate would have it, they managed to locate us again. Admidst the pandemonium, I could feel the sounds of feet thundering outside our makeshift camp. 7 metres. The noise was unbearable as they were disrupting the conscious flow of thoughts to my head. In a fit of anger, I yelled, projecting my voice as far as I could,"STOP RIGHT NOW." 5 metres. Shocked by the sudden disruption, people had ceased with their uncivilised behaviour, quietening down instantly. Good, but dread was looming. 3 metres...
Two metres... 
O n e m e t r e. 
Then, the door burst open. I had failed.
